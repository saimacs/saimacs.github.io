Recognizing the emotive meaning of text can add another dimension to the understanding of text. We study the task of automatically categorizing sentences in a text into Ekman's six basic emotion categories. We experiment with corpus-based features as well as features derived from 
two emotion lexicons. One lexicon is automatically built using the classification system of  Rogetâ€™s Thesaurus, while the other consists of words extracted from WordNet-Affect. Experiments on the data 
obtained from blogs show that a combination of corpus-based unigram features with emotion-related features provides superior classification performance. We achieve F-measure values that outperform the rule-based baseline method for all emotion classes.
